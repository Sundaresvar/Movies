🎬 Movie Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Excel)

📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based data analysis of a mock movie dataset. It demonstrates advanced SQL techniques to extract insights from a relational database and visualize them in an Excel dashboard. The goal is to simulate a real-world analytics scenario that could be used by a movie studio or streaming platform.

🗂️ Dataset Structure
The project uses four main tables:

Tables:
movies -	Movie titles, release year, genre, director, box office revenue
directors	- List of movie directors
genres - Movie genres (e.g., Action, Drama)
ratings -	Ratings for each movie (1.0 to 10.0)

🧠 SQL Concepts Used
✅ Joins (INNER JOIN)
✅ Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
✅ Grouping and Sorting
✅ Window Functions (RANK(), OVER())
✅ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
✅ Filtering with WHERE, HAVING, and LIMIT

📁 Files Included
File	Description
movie_project.db	SQLite database with all movie data
movies.csv, directors.csv, genres.csv, ratings.csv	Raw data exports
